## Problem Statement : ##

<br>

*To design a next generation secure, transparent, tamper proof voting system built on the
foundations of the blockchain.*

<br>
<br>

## Dependencies : ##

<br>

In order to build and run our project we need a few dependencies :

<br>

### Node Packet Manager (NPM) ###

The first dependency is NPM which comes with Node.js. You can check if you have NPM by typing the following in your terminal:

`$ node -v`

You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en)

<br>

### Truffle Framework ###

Next dependency is Truffle Framework which allows us to build decentralized applications on Ethereum blockchain. It also provides us with tools which allow us to deploy smart contracts using Solidity language. It aslo helps us develop client side applications.

You can install Truffle by typing the following in your terminal : 

`$ npm install -g truffle`

<br>

### Ganache ###

Ganache is a local in-memory blockchain. It helps us simulate an Ethereum blockchain with 10 accounts which are preloaded 100 fake ether each.

You can download Truffle Framework by clicking [here](https://truffleframework.com/ganache)

<br>

### Metamask ###

The next dependency is Metamask which is a Google Chrome extension. Since blockchain is a network in itself we need a special browser to connect to it. We'll be able to connect to our local blockchain using our own local account with the help of Metamask. 

You can download Metamask by clicking [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)

You will need to install Google Chrome if you dont have it. After installing make sure it is enabled in your list of extensions. You'll see a a fox icon in the top right corner of your screen.

<br>

### Text Editor ###

Basic editor to view and modify code. I'll recommend using Sublime Text because it has plugins for syntax highliting for Solidity language.

You can install the free version by clicking [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

<br>

### Syntax Highlighting (optional) ###

Optional but highly recommended to easily read and write Solidity code, which may not be highlighted properly on some editors.

You can install ["Ethereum Package"](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Ethereum) that provides accurate syntax highlighting for Solidity.
